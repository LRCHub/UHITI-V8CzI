Dead or alive, won't someone tell me if I'm low or I'm high?
I just don't know if I am dead or alive, I got no feelings 'cause I'm so cold inside
Just miss her sittin' by the phone
Don't try to reach her, 'cause she just wants to be alone
No explanation, just a mystery
You took your things and took your life right outta me
I don't see why you had to be so cloak and dagger
But it's all over now, oh what I think just doesn't matter
You took every, every drop of life from me
You left me lyin' in a coma and in agony
Dead or alive, won't someone tell me if I'm low or I'm high?
I just don't know if I am dead or alive, I got no feelings 'cause I'm so cold inside
You gave me somethin' that is hard to disguise
Never knowing if I'm dead or alive, dead or alive
Your bed is empty and my heart is bare
You turned our happiness in to this sad affair
I never dreamt that it would come to this
Left me no reason or even a goodbye kiss
I don't know why you really had to pull the trigger
My name was on the bullet, something that I didn't figure
You stole every, everything I had to steal
You took my reason and you even took my love as well
Dead or alive, won't someone tell me if I'm low or I'm high?
I just don't know if I am dead or alive, I got no feelings 'cause I'm so cold inside
You gave me somethin' that is hard to disguise
Never knowing if I'm dead or alive, dead or alive
I can't wait, for the doctor's verdict
I got a feelin' what he's sayin' I already heard it
I was dead, dead before I hit the ground
And you're the only one, the only one to bring me 'round
Dead or alive, won't someone tell me if I'm low or I'm high?
I just don't know if I am dead or alive, I got no feelings 'cause I'm so cold inside
You gave me somethin' that is hard to disguise
Never knowing if I'm dead or alive, dead or alive
