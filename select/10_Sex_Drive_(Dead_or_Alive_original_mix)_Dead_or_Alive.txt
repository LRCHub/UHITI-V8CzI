Oh, the suns going down, the nights coming in
I got a brain for business and a body for sin
So shoot like a rocket 'cause my engine is hot
If you want whats forbidden baby that's what I got

Sex drive, sex drive, sex drive
Sex drive, sex drive, sex drive

Sex drive it sees no gender or color
So let's get together and collide with each other
Sex drive, aw you know how it feels
Get out of my car and get under my wheels

Sex drive, sex drive, sex drive
Sex drive

French kisses a thing of the past
Were too young to die so we'd better live fast
The dying is easy the urge is so hard
If your looking for funking then get into my car

I'm a Mercedes Benz so why don't you jump in
I got a rear view mirror you can watch us in
The harder you drive the smoother I go
I got my engine running

Sex drive it sees no gender or color
So let's get together and collide with each other
Sex drive, aw you know how it feels
Get out of my car and get under my wheels

Sex drive, sex drive, sex drive
Sex drive

Oh, the suns coming down, the nights coming in
I got a brain for business and a body for sin
So shoot like a rocket 'cause my engine is hot
If you want whats forbidden baby that's what I got

Sex drive it sees no gender or color
So let's get together and collide with each other
Sex drive, aw you know how it feels
Get out of my car and get under my wheels

Sex drive
Get under my wheels
Get under my wheels
Get under my wheels

Sex drive it sees no gender or color
So let's get together and collide with each other
Sex drive, aw you know how it feels
Get out of my car and get under my wheels

Sex drive, sex drive, sex drive
Sex drive, hey
