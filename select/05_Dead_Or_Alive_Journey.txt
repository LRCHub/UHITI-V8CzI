A double secret agent
And he was paid to kill
With cold steel magnum force
Is how the man possessed the skill
He shot a man in Paris
He did a job in L.A
And if the price was right, he'd surely
Take your life away
Wanted, wanted
Wanted dead or alive
Blood for money, money
Assault, homicide
Blood for money, money
Money, money
Oh yeah
Watch it
He drove a Maserati
Lived up in the hills
A cat with nine lives that's gone
Too far to feel the chill
He never though it'd happen
It was his last mistake
'Cause he was gunned down by a
Heartless woman's 38
Wanted dead or alive
Blood for money, money
Assault, homicide
Blood for money, money
Money, money, money, money
